# Nordic FHIR Base Profiles

This is a FHIR implementation guide **meant only to be used to support harmonization efforts of
Nordic FHIR base profile implementation guides**.

We're currently using the build.fhir.org infrastructure to publish the rendered guide.
See
[https://build.fhir.org/ig/fhir-fi/nordic-base/](https://build.fhir.org/ig/fhir-fi/nordic-base/) for
the master version, or browse
[all branches](https://build.fhir.org/ig/fhir-fi/nordic-base/branches/).

The most valuable output is probably the
[generated quality assurance report](https://build.fhir.org/ig/fhir-fi/nordic-base/qa.html).

Currently the inputs are authored manually, copy-pasting content from all the base profile
specifications.
