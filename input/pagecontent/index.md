# Nordic Base Profile Experimentation

Checking how much the Nordic FHIR base profiles differ from each other.


TODO:
1) Create profiles for all resource types profiled by any of the Nordic IGs.
   One that imposes all (?) the Nordic profiles for that resource type. 
2) Import all the examples from all the base specifications.
   Make all examples examples of the relevant Nordic profile.
3) See the QA report...
